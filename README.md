# ðŸ§  Bin Packing AI Solver

This Python project aims to solve the classic **Bin Packing Problem** using various algorithms (heuristic and AI-based). The goal is to compare their effectiveness on the same input data (with fixed random seed).

## ðŸ“¦ Problem Overview

The task is to pack a set of items with different sizes into the smallest number of bins with fixed capacity.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Implement and test multiple algorithms for solving the Bin Packing Problem.
- Evaluate their performance through iterative optimization.

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

- **Improvement**: Difference in the number of bins used between the first and last iteration.
- **Execution Time**: Total runtime in seconds.
